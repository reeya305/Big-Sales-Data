# Big Sales Data Prediction

This project focuses on predicting sales using a machine learning model based on historical sales data and relevant features. The goal is to accurately forecast future sales trends and provide insights for decision-making.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast sales based on various features such as product type, store location, time of year, etc.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preparation:** Importing and cleaning sales data for training the model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Applying machine learning models to predict sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
- **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict future sales based on new input data.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/big-sales-data-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd big-sales-data-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Big_sales_data_prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to train the model and make predictions.

## Model

The notebook implements machine learning algorithms to forecast sales. The primary steps include:

1. Data Loading: Historical sales data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
3. Model Building: Training a regression model to predict sales based on input features.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
